# Custom-browser
This is the code for creating a custom browser on Python.

You would need to import the following module to execute it:
PyQt5

How to install:
1. Go to your IDE's terminal
2. Input "pip install PyQt5" without quotation marks


Note:
- This browser has nothing special in it. It only has a basic design and no symbols to represent back, front or reload.
- When you input onto the blank space, you need to input the link as it ONLY READS LINKS.
- Because it uses google as a default search engine, this browser mostly works like google.
